## About
Got a unique sample pack?

SMPLIT is a alternative for posting your own samples and download directly from other producers. We know how hard it can be to get some recognition when your ideas don't get as much attention as you wished. And that's what we're trying to solve!

As an independent producer myself, me and my friends missed 2 things:

- A dedicated space for independent/small producers
- A centralized space for finding samples

SMPLIT is a centralized plataform for getting your samples directly by other producers, just like you. We offer the opportunity for uploading samples directly to our platform and downloading from other producers. You can filter samples by genre, tempo and key, listen to samples before downloading them (exclusive to free samples) and find packs with multiples samples to download them all at once.

## Features

Since our plataform is able to upload and download audio you can perform the following actions:

### Upload

You can select one or multiple audios (sample pack) from your computer and upload into our plataform. You can also give details about each sample before publishing, such as:
- Tempo
- Genre
- Description
- Key
- ~Price~

If it looks about right, just press the **Submit** button.

### Download

If you found a nice sounding sample you can click the **Download** button at the bottom of the sample pack and the download should start right away.
